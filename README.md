# TitanicSurvivorsPredictionUsingXGBoost
Classification of survivors on-board titanic using XGBoost classifer.
The classifier tries to predict a passenger will survive or not based on gender, travel class, embarked and age.
In this project I have gone through the entire cycle of a machine learning project from data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and evaluation metrics.
